  <h1>Kankon - KankonDevs</h1>
  <p>The story ends with a comparison of Jim and Dellaâ€™s gifts to the gifts that the Magi, or three wise men, gave to Baby Jesus within the manger within the biblical story of Christmas. The narrator concludes that Jim and Della are far wiser than the Magi because their gifts are gifts of affection, and people who give out of affection and self-sacrifice are truly wise because they know the worth of self-giving love.</p>
