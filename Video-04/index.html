  <p style="background-color: mistyrose;">The story takes place in a cottage maintained by an orphanage in the Carolina mountains. The narrator, presumably a woman, has come to the cottage seeking a quiet place to write.</p>
  
  <p>Before leaving, the narrator stops at the orphanage to say goodbye to Jerry, and to leave money for the headmistress to purchase gifts for Jerry on holidays and birthdays. It is then that Rawlings ends her story with a dose of irony: Jerry has not been receiving gifts from his mother in Mannville; in fact, Jerry does not have a mother.</p>
